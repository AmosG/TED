# A Matlab Toolbox for the Temporal Differences (TED) Compressed Sensing Method

Demonstration for Temperature Monitoring in MR-guided-HIFU scans
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Temporal Differences (TED) [1] Compressed Sensing is a dynamic MRI method that enables reconstruction from sub-sampled k-space data.

TED assumes that k-space data is fully acquired in the baseline time frame (t=0), and reconstructs k-space data in later time frames. Here, TED is implemented for temperature estimation from MR-guided-HIFU acquisitions [1].


TED is more general and can be applied to other dynamic MRI applications (such as cardiac MRI).

If you find a cool implementation - let us know!

 ============================================


This Matlab toolbox contains two demos for temperature change reconstruction from MR-guided-HIFU data:
1. Gel phantom data, acquiredw with a GE scanner.
2. Agar phantom data, acquired with a Philips scanner.

In both cases, fully sampled data was acquired in-vitro and then retrospectively subsampled offline, so a reference temperature map is computed from the fully-sampled dataset.

TED was compared with two well-established methods: *l*1-SPIRiT [2] and the K-space Hybrid Method [3].

## Getting Started
Clone or download the CORE-PI code.


## Running the examples
Open the demo_start.m function in Matlab, choose one example from the following list, set the desired
reduction factor (R), and run the code.
